    "text": "Assignment Flow\nThis project is set up to scaffold this user guide and set you up for success.\nStart at topic.qmd and identify a topic for your user guide.\nOnce you’ve proposed a topic and received my approval/feedback, you can convert the contents of topic.qmd into an introductory paragraph in your report. Please leave the topic.qmd file as an appendix, to document the different stages of this project.\nOnce we’ve agreed on a topic for your user guide, you will proceed to needs.qmd and task-analysis.qmd. Both will be submitted at the same check-in, and both will be included in your final report as appendices. You should be able to re-purpose most of the information in task-analysis.qmd to orient the user to different components of the task you’ve chosen.\nYour next step is to actually write the content that satisfies the work you outlined in task-analysis.qmd.\nOnce you’re finished with that, ideally, you’ll have plenty of time to edit and streamline your report. Feel free to trade reports with a friend and try to complete your friend’s task - this will help you both identify areas where the guide isn’t as clear. Try to complete the task with a different data set - that often helps find trouble spots.\nWhen you submit your final report, you may remove index.qmd from the _quarto.yml file, which will remove this chapter (which is quite unnecessary for your user) from the report. You should also take the time to make sure your name is listed as both author and copyright holder in the _quarto.yml file. Feel free to make a custom cover for your manual if you would like to do so. You can also tweak the CSS/theme for the book, so long as you’re conscious of accessibility concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the report\n\n\n\nIf you are using RStudio to complete this report, you can hit (Ctrl/Cmd)-Shift-B to build the whole report. You can also type quarto render . on the command line in the project folder to accomplish the same thing.\nIf you have questions about how to customize or debug your book, it may be helpful to start at the quarto book documentation (Posit PBC 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosit PBC. 2024. “Creating a Book.

    "text": "For the scope, I plan to write a user guide that goes through how to set up a compartment model in R. I would have to research the packages that could be used and find a data set in order to provide an example of how to set up the model. Potentially, I could simulate a data set, but more research would be needed to figure out what data would need to be simulated.\nA compartment model would use the following differential equations that model the SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) framework.\n\\[\\frac{dS(t)}{dt}=-\\beta\\frac{S(t)I(t)}{N},\\] \\[\\frac{dI(t)}{dt}=\\beta\\frac{S(t)I(t)}{N}-\\sigma E(t),\\] \\[\\frac{dI(t)}{dt}=\\sigma E(t)-\\gamma I(t),\\] \\[\\frac{dR(t)}{dt}=\\gamma I(t),\\]\nOne interesting topic that I could consider is using COVID-19 data as one of the referenced articles used SAPHIRE, a different compartmental model, to simulate the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Singapore. The data was made available in the article found here. Their code for their model is found here as well, only needing modifications to fit the simpler SEIR framework.",

You don’t have to specifically answer each one of these (and some may not apply), but they should get you started thinking in the right direction.\nWhat are the prerequisites, for both knowledge and e.g. software setup?\nWhat are the basic requirements for any data that the method is used on? - Are missing values allowed? - Should the data be confined within a certain range? - Does the data have to be approximately normally distributed?\nWhat are the basic components of the task? - Outline these in a bit more detail\nWhat decisions does the user need to be prepared to make on the fly?\nWhat questions should the user ask of the “first draft” of the product? What adjustments may need to be made?\nYour check-in should answer these basic questions (and similar concerns that apply more directly to your topic).\nOnce you’ve completed the check-in, you can use this section to jump-start an introduction/set-up/getting started section in your user guide. This document should remain as an appendix to your main report.",
